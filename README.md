🕯️ **Introducing Residential Evil — A 3D Horror Survival Experience**  

The game blends atmospheric storytelling with real-time combat mechanics while trapped in a dark, abandoned house, the player must survive against restless ghosts that grow stronger over time, using ammo, a safety flashlight, and stamina-based sprinting. The player defeats mannequin ghosts to unlock a door and ultimately rescue the player’s lost beloved while surviving a tense, fear-filled environment.

The game was developed using Python to implement the core gameplay logic. Used GLUT for input processing and window management while OpenGL was used to render the immersive 3D graphics.

📌**Core Gameplay Highlights**
- The home menu shows basic controls and gameplay instructions.
- A flashlight that freezes the ghosts can be toggled on and off for safety of the player using the "F" key.
- The player shoots a bullet using the Space bar.
- Colliding with a ghost costs the player one life.
- Health packs are placed randomly in corridors to restore health.
- Mannequin ghosts spawn randomly and increase in speed and damage over time.
- Safe zones make the player invisible and immune to attacks.
- Camera flickers and the screen flashes red when taking damage.
- First-person/third-person toggle with smooth interpolation using the "E" key.
- Defeat mannequins ghosts to progress through the level and unlock the door.
- Each level grows more difficult, and the game can be restarted using R.

Working on this project strengthened my skills in understanding 3D graphics programming with Python and OpenGL. I also learned to manage complex game states, object interactions, and performance optimizations while maintaining a playable and interactive environment. This project improved my problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and attention to visual detail.
